# notes
# global names seem "easy": they show up as BindingID in the source tree and have an info populated in `ctx.binding.info`
# qualified names seem a bit harder, they show up like this:
#
# [call]                                   │
#   top.getproperty    :: top              │
#   #₈/ExplicitImports :: BindingId        │
#   :check_no_implicit_imports :: Symbol   │ scope_layer=1
#
# so here `check_no_implicit_imports` is a qualified name, we can see it as a child of call,
# where we are calling getproperty on ExplicitImports and `check_no_implicit_imports`.
# so if we want to check you are calling it from the "right" module, we need to follow the tree,
# find this pattern, then check the module against the symbol.
# That's what we already do, but now we should have more precision in knowing the module I think

# Ok, so something we could do is basically like what we do now in `get_names_used`:
# 1. find the leaves. Throw out anything whose `kind` isn't a BindingId or a Symbol (I think)
# 2. Symbols may be qualified; check if the parent is `.`. Then the first parent is the module(?). If not qualified then not interesting (?)
# 3. BindingIds are potential globals, and are potentially qualifying another name
